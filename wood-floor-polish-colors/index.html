<p><strong>Wood Floor Polish Colors</strong>, The answer is usually YES. Wax finishes will form white bubbles or spots when exposed to water for about ten minutes. Stains and finishes can range from light blonde to rich mahogany and these neutral hues play an important role in a rooms overall color scheme. Before you can restore a shellacked or varnished floor the entire wood surface will have to be sanded removing the finish and then restained and resurfaced.</p>
