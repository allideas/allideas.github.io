<h3 id="nothing-could-be-further-from-the-truth">Nothing could be further from the truth.</h3><p>The most common misconception about engineered hardwood is that its fake wood flooring. Engineered wood floors come ready to be installed so staining on-site isnt necessary. Unlike engineered floors which are floated over a sublayer and require no nailing or glue hardwood floors are attached to a subfloor usually plywood or furring strips over a vapor barrier. Engineered planks are also more stable and less prone to expansion and contraction from humidity. Engineered hardwood is typically less expensive than hardwood flooring as ranges in price from about 250 to 10 per square foot while hardwood typically averages about 4 to 12 per square foot. The planks are nailed to the subfloor through the tongue so the nails dont show when the floor is completed. Solid hardwood flooring may cost less in some cases but will cost more to install because it must be sanded and finished driving up the final cost.</p>
