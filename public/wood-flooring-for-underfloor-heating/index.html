In this post we share our recommendations for specifying a suitable wood floor and fitting over UFH systems. When laying a floor over underfloor heating loops the working temperature should be at least 18C. Your wood floor must be laid close to the subfloor and without an air gap as air gaps can cause the wood to dry out very quickly. Just like engineered wood flooring the maximum underfloor heating temperature for laminate flooring is 27 degrees Celsius. But a softer and less dense wood attention must be paid to the thickness of floorboards. The natural properties of wood also mean that it has a fast heat-up time whilst also resisting heat from escaping too quickly making wood helpful in maximising the energy-efficiency of an underfloor heating system.</p>
