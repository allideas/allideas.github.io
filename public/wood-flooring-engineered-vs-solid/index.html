<p>Solid Vs Engineered Hardwood Which Is Better Engineered Hardwood Engineered Hardwood Flooring Engineered Wood Floors Some people choose solid hardwood flooring or engineered wood flooring based on aesthetics. But engineered wood is simply a veneer for your floor. Plus its easy to install over radiant heat hence less expansion and contraction. Solid hardwood is timeless and gorgeous but lets face it high maintenance. Solid hardwood flooring can be screened and refinished more frequently than the thinner veneer of engineered wood flooring. Thereafter those boards are topped off with a lamella or top layer of solid wood.</p>

<p>Differences Between Solid And Engineered Hardwood Flooring Wood Floors Wide Plank Engineered Wood Floors Engineered Hardwood Flooring If you have a tight budget for your floor then engineered hardwood usually works out more cost effective than solid. Expect a solid hardwood floor to give you anywhere between 80 to 100 years service compared to around 50 years for a well-looked-after engineered floor. The difference between a solid wood floor board and a good quality engineered floor board that has a minimum top layer thickness of 4mm or 6mm is minimal. Solid wood floors are slightly more expensive than an engineered wood flooring but if you are a diehard wood flooring enthusiast then you may want to stick with a solid hardwood flooring. As the name implies solid hardwood is solid wood all the way through. Engineered wood flooring supplies the same classic effect but often at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>What 39 S The Difference Between Solid And Engineered Hardwood Flooring Which B Engineered Hardwood Flooring Engineered Hardwood Solid Hardwood Floors Engineered floors today have a wear layer that is as thin as 5 mm and up. A floor with a 4 mm wear layer can be sanded as many times as a solid wood floor if the desire should ever arise to have it refinished. Plus its easy to install over radiant heat hence less expansion and contraction. Production builders prefer engineered products over solid wood because they tolerate differences in humidity and temperature better which makes them easier to control. But the most critical factor to deciding between solid or engineered is the type of home you live in where your home is located and your preferences as to the performance of your floor from season to season. Engineered wood flooring on the other hand is made up of cleverly constructed core boards that are effectively layers and layers of ply that are bonded together.</p>
