And keep the relative humidity RH in every room between 45 at the low-end and 60 at the high-end. As long as some basic guidelines are followed these problems are completely unnecessary. The engineered wood flooring needs to be glued down with a full surface bond not lines of glue using a flexible flooring adhesive to allow the floor to expand and contract as the temperature generated by the underfloor heating rises and falls. A moisture barrier and heat distribution layer must be installed as close to the wooden floor as possible to stop the floor from drying out and becoming damaged.</p>
