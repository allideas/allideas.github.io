<p>Goplus 2in1 Pneumatic Flooring Nailer And Stapler 16gauge Cleat Air Hardwood Flooring Tool With Rubber Mallet B Flooring Tools Nailer Chrome Kitchen Faucet In my experience a 15-gauge finish nailer can work well for hardwood floor installation. If youre shopping for a finish nailer Id recommend the larger 15-gauge gun simply because the fatter nails provide more holding power. With a brad or finish nailer you may also want to increase the depth setting to ensure that the head is not protruding out. A 15-gauge may initially appear to have the advantage in that a sturdier nail should logically afford a stronger fastener. Anyone using a floor nailer ends up using a finish nailer for the first and last few rows. Nail heads usually are countersunk and the depressions filled with wood putty before the floor is sealed.</p>
