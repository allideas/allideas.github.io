<p><strong>Wood Flooring Gray Brown</strong>, Grays Brown offers a superior range of solid engineered wood floor options. Grey floors are easier to keep clean than dark brown hardwood floors because they show less dust. Colors like white beige taupe shades of brown and gray all go well with wood floors in general because they create a perfectly balanced look. If your home and furniture are more traditional but you want to modernize things a bit I would suggest more of a brown grey or a medium brown stain with a slight gray undertone.</p>
