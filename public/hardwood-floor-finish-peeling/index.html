Although it may not be a perfect repair it will be a lot cheaper and less work than refinishing the entire floor. Moisture issues can cause excessive wood swelling and increase the chances for delamination. In the dining rooms and entry way there are rugs on the hardwood floors with no pads and apparently water must have been spilled in a couple of areas and has seeped through to the floor because the polyurethane is peeling off in long strips.
