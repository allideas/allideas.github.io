<p><strong>Can Lvl Be Used As Floor Joists</strong>, Laminated Veneer Lumber LVL can be used as beams headers joists and rims in commercial applications. All of the components are engineered to the industrys highest standards to help contractors build. LVL beams are dead straight which was a big advantage on this project compared to glulam beams that usually have a crown. Now for floor joists.</p>

<p>If you happen to have LVL floor joists which are uncommon due to their cost then the process of sistering them would be similar to sistering dimensional lumber. 2 grade there is a method that can be used for estimating beam spans for a preliminary design. RigidLam LVL which is used for headers beams columns studs and stair stringers. If the code andor drawings say it should be there put it in. LVL beams are dead straight which was a big advantage on this project compared to glulam beams that usually have a crown.</p>

Lets examine three of these materials. Manufactured from LVL and oriented strand board OSB e-joist has a similar strength as a solid LVL beam of the same size but uses much less wood making it lighter and easier to handle. Laminated Veneer Lumber LVL can be used as beams headers joists and rims in commercial applications. RigidLam LVL which is used for headers beams columns studs and stair stringers. I beam floor joists feature a top and bottom flange which is either a 23 24 or an LVL. Joists are horizontal supports that span from wall to wall wall to beam or beam to beam.</p>
