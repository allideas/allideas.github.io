<p>Provenza Lvp Floors First Crush Provenza Moda Living First Crush Flooring Waterproof Flooring Vinyl Plank The main difference between a Luxury Vinyl Plank LVP and an Engineered Vinyl Plank EVP is the core materials and durability. And if hardwood isnt pre-finished then expect labor costs to increase. With EVP the heavier the flooring becomes the weight helps to hold it down. Both EVP and LVP have their pros and cons but EVP has a superior core material than LVP thus the best flooring. They can easily stain from the liquid. I was so excited to learn the pros and cons of each I.</p>

<p>Solid Hardwood Vs Engineered Hardwood Vs Luxury Vinyl Planks Ferma Flooring Vinyl Plank Engineered Hardwood Luxury Vinyl Plank Both EVP and LVP have their pros and cons but EVP has a superior core material than LVP thus the best flooring. If the price of real lvp is that much I couldnt ever tell anyone to go with it because engineered hardwood is just a better option and the only real disadvantage is the waterproof part. Both solid hardwood and engineered hardwood are not waterproof and this is why they are not recommended for areas with high humidity and moisture. Engineered hardwood is not as susceptible to the affects of humidity making it a great choice for kitchen flooring or bathroom flooring Readers might be curious where should I not install hardwood. The wood floors will STAIN the vinyl sitting on top of them AND the vinyl is going to STAIN the wood sitting below it. Wood varies on price because the harder the hardwood is the more money it costs.</p>
