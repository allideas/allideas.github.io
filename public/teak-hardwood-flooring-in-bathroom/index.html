<p><strong>Teak Hardwood Flooring In Bathroom</strong>, Moisture tends to seep in through the soil underground and could cause the teak to decay prematurely. If youre seeking non-slip shower mat its naturally non-slipping surface will keep you safe from accidents. This would eat up some height but you could frame the floor on sleepers and allow gaps then use something like EPDM sloping to a center drain under a floating floor of teak built like pallets and just laid on the waterproof membrane over thiset to provide drainage slope over plywood over joists. Plus teak shower floor mats are naturally warm and mold resistant.</p>
