<p>What Size Expansion Gap Is Required For Laminate Flooring Diyist As a general rule when installing solid Â¾ hardwood a 34 expansion space must be left around the perimeter and all vertical obstructions.

In fact wooden flooring that has been properly prepared and installed will indeed show seasonal cracks between the floorboards. The larger the room the larger the gap must be. This is not a sign of a problem with your flooring though as this shrinkage and expansion is quite normal.</p>
