The flooring store said to leave one quarter inch gaps for expansion at the wallsnow the boards are lifting off the floor Ill informed advice like this often leads to floor problems. If you are attempting to search for concepts for 19 Stylish Hardwood Floor Expansion Gap then this is the place to be.

<p>What Size Expansion Gap Is Required For Laminate Flooring Diyist As a general rule when installing solid ¾ hardwood a 34 expansion space must be left around the perimeter and all vertical obstructions. The expansion gap needed also depends on the manufacturers recommendations - different materials expand at different degrees. The gap between the hardwood flooring and any obstruction should be a minimum of 58 inch and 34 inch is actually better as shown in Figure 2. In fact wooden flooring that has been properly prepared and installed will indeed show seasonal cracks between the floorboards. The larger the room the larger the gap must be. This is not a sign of a problem with your flooring though as this shrinkage and expansion is quite normal.</p>
