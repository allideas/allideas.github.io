<p>How To Install Hardwood Floor Over Particle Board Patchwork Pebbles My subfloors are 2x8s which require underlayment to install either carpet or hardwood floor. You should never float solid hardwoods over particle board. Hardwood were installed over the 12 when they were new and had no problems. Plywood will shrink back to its original shape after it expands. At SOME point I will be demoing that tile floor and want the plywood underlayment to be level with the underlayment in the new floor I am starting now. Instead glue the wood to the particleboard underlayment.</p>

There are several issues with this subfloor. You should never float solid hardwoods over particle board. Both NOFMA and the NWFA do not recommend installing a nailed down floor over particle board. If this type of underlayment is present it will have to be removed when planning to install a nail or glue down hardwood floor. The adjacent room is ceramic tile which is on top of plywood on top of particle board on top of plywood subfloor.</p>

<p>How To Install Hardwood Floor Over Particle Board Patchwork Pebbles As a whole OSB is not the best option to use as an underlayment for engineered hardwood and the main reason is that it puffs up when it comes into contact with water and doesnt shrink back again. Hardwood floor nowadays is manufactured as tongue-and-groove and quickly installed with a nail gun and standard 175 length nails. That will be part of a project next year. Particleboard doesnt grip nails strongly enough to maintain the integrity of your new hardwood floor. At SOME point I will be demoing that tile floor and want the plywood underlayment to be level with the underlayment in the new floor I am starting now. If this type of underlayment is present it will have to be removed when planning to install a nail or glue down hardwood floor.</p>

<p>6 Wide Plywood Planks Being Laid Down Over Osb Subfloor Atop Concrete Slab Hardwood Floors Osb Flooring Ive seen it done but dont recommend it. The floors are creaky and warped in places and Ive been strongly advised not to install hardwood floors over particle board as they cannot hold nails and will deteriorate if water is spilled. Remove the particle board as it will not hold the nails. It is definitely not a good substrate for hardwood flooringor any flooring for that matter. The floor will squeak after a short time. Beside above should particle board subfloor.</p>

<p>Pin On Project Supplies If this type of underlayment is present it will have to be removed when planning to install a nail or glue down hardwood floor. The floors are creaky and warped in places and Ive been strongly advised not to install hardwood floors over particle board as they cannot hold nails and will deteriorate if water is spilled. The floor will squeak after a short time. The nails go in at an angle and will not go thru the main floor enough to get a good bite. The 14 luan is. Self leveling compound over particle board underlayment not subfloor.</p>
