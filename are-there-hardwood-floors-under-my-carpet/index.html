<p><strong>Are There Hardwood Floors Under My Carpet</strong>, Our boys were little when we bought the house and our daughter was on the way. The biggest risk is what does the hardwood look like under the rest of the carpet. We did our hardwood floors in my last house by taking razor blades and scraping the paint spatters off then steel wool on the bad spots followed by a hardwood floor cleaner. I took it up and there are really pretty hardwood floors underneath.</p>
