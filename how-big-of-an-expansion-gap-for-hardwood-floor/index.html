<p>Parquet Flooring Expansion Gap Hardwood And Engineeredhardwood Flooring Hardwood Floors Wood Floors No expansion gap in hardwood floors. That mainly depends on how much grain runoff is in any one piece of flooring an 18 should cover it though.

<p>Incredible Home Hacks Fix Wood Scratches With A Walnut Scratched Wood Scratched Wood Floors Laminate Flooring It is not absolutely necessary to remove baseboards to install new hardwoods but remember that wood floors require an expansion gap of 12 inch along the surrounding walls to accommodate expansion and contraction with changes in moisture and humidity. However should you have any concerns or doubts as to how large a gap to leave and how often it should be included when fitting an engineered wood floor always seek expert advice. For hardwood floors a gap of at least 12mm should be left around the whole edge of the room including all doorways fire places and around any pipework. The larger the room the more space will be needed in the case of expanding hardwood. The acclimation period can be between 4 to 14 days or longer. An engineered hardwood takes it much better than a solid.</p>

<p>Scotia Solid Hardwood Floor Beading Solid Hardwood Floors Flooring Solid Hardwood With all the flooring types being considered here an expansion gap is to be provided to the perimeter of the floor and is hidden by the skirting or by beading. That will be no concern for movement there although I would still get a small gap minimally an 18 most certainly not tight since the wood does move albeit slightly in its length.
