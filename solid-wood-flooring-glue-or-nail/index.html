<p>Makati Maple From The Vintage Couture Collection By Heritage Woodcraft Featuring Premium Grade Wide Engineered Hardwood Flooring Engineered Hardwood Flooring For engineered strips and planks the recommended spacing is between four and eight inches.

Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. As an installation method glue down is particularly suited to either concrete or wood subfloors or any other solid surface where the glue will bond easily. By adding another 38 inch for expansion our line was measured 3 78 off the drywall.</p>
