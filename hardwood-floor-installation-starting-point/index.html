<p>Herringbone Wooden Floor In A Hallway Wood Floor Design Herringbone Wooden Floors Herringbone Wood Floor The Floormasters forum was hosted online from 19972015 by wood flooring legend Bill Price Sr. General wisdom suggests that you should start on an exterior wall because it is likely to be the most square but that may not always be the best point to begin. Also is it necessary to use a sacrificial row or can you. In more complex rooms you will want to pick a starting point that eases the installation. Once you get to the wall nail that board in and use it as a starting point. In a simple rectangular room the starting point will be against one of the walls.</p>

Wood floors should always be laid perpendicular to floor joistsacross rather that in between them. As the picture shows if I put a starting line parallel to the starting wall like most installation instructions recommend once I get to the opposite wall I will have a strip that will have 14 on one end. Every hardwood installation has to start somewhere. Im going to be laying hardwood floors but I had a question about the starting chalk line when the walls are not parallel. I dont want transition between hallway and bedrooms.</p>
