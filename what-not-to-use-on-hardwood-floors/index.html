<p>Avoid using harsh detergents that will dull the surface of your floors. Dried candle wax crayon marks and chewing gum on floors with surface or penetrating finishes readily come away with ice. But vinegar should not be used as a hardwood floor cleaner because its acidity can lead to etching in the woods surface. MFMA does not recommend the use of masking theatrical construction electrical duct adhesive or any other kind of tape to mark temporary court boundaries on the surface of a finished maple floor. Its gentle yet effective low-VOC formula cleans and creates a stunning natural sheen.</p>

Then lets clean with Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner or a mixture of vinegar and water 1 cup white vinegar for every gallon of warm water. Fill a freezer bag with a few ice cubes then place. Dont use DIY wood floor cleaner containing vinegar when mopping your hardwood floors because it can damage the finish.
