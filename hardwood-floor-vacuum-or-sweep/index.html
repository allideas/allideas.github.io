As Im sweeping my floor for the 2nd time today I was wondering if people prefer sweeping or vacuuming. The best means of cleaning hardwood floors is to use a microfiber dust mop or a vacuum cleaner. Try a stick vacuum like BISSELL 81L2W that can perform better than a broom or floor mop. This corded canister model delivers exceptional performance on bare surfaces like hardwood floors as it sucks up pet hair small debris like rice and bulky material like cereal without any issue.</p>

The problem with sweeping wood floors is that it just kicks dust into the air.</p>
